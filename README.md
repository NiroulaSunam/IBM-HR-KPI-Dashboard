# 📈 IBM HR Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project addresses the organization's high 16.1% employee attrition rate by identifying the key drivers of turnover. The workflow involved **Python for initial data preparation and statistical insights**, followed by **Tableau for interactive visualization** and business intelligence reporting.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Total Employees:** 1,470
* **Total Attrition:** 237
* **Overall Attrition Rate:** 16.1%
* **Average Monthly Salary:** $6,503

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Workflow
1.  **Data Preparation (Python):** Used **Pandas** for data cleaning, type conversion, and preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check for outliers and identify key correlations before visualization.
2.  **Visualization (Tableau):** Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize attrition rates broken down by Salary Range, Job Role, Department, and Age Group.
3.  **Reporting:** Synthesized visual insights into actionable business recommendations.

## 📊 Critical Findings & Business Recommendations

The analysis revealed several high-risk areas:

### Critical Findings Summary:
* **Role Risk:** Highest attrition in **Sales Representatives (39.8%)** and **Laboratory Technicians**, indicating potential issues with workload, compensation, or career clarity.
* **Age Risk:** The **18-25 age group** shows the highest volatility and attrition rate, suggesting entry-level engagement or retention programs are lacking.
* **Departmental Risk:** High attrition in the **Sales (20.6%)** and **Human Resources (19.0%)** departments.

### Recommendation:
A **Job Architecture Review** is recommended, focusing specifically on **entry-level salary benchmarking** and establishing **clear promotion pipelines** for high-risk roles (Sales/Lab Tech) to reduce 'stagnation' turnover.
